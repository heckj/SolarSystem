Procedural generation of solar systems, modeled on physical processes although not entirely scientifically accurate with current astrophysics hypothesis and knowledge.

This is a port of extensive work by multiple other authors, used under license.
The history of this code has had a variety of names, including StarGen, StarForm, and Accrete, with an extensive and varied history.
The original program was written in Fortran in 1970 at Rand, following Stephen H. Dole published "Formation of Planetary Systems by Aggregation: A Computer Simulation".
In 1985, Martyn Fogg wrote a version of it and published his results.
Matt Burdick followed on to create a version first in Pascal, and then in C, called "starform" that showed up on the net in about 1988.
Several versions of starform have since been developed and distributed by Ian Burrell, Carl Burke and Chris Croughton AKA Keris.
The code that this ports from was written by Jim Burrows, with the most recent update being somewhere around 2008.
Each of the authors has attempted to preserve the credits of those who came before, but it is often hard to know whose voice the different bits are written in. This is my attempt to continue the tradition of giving Credit where credit is due. I've missed things and made mistakes, no doubt.

A far more [thorough history of this code](https://github.com/zakski/accrete-starform-stargen/blob/master/docs/authors%20-%20by%20source%20year.md) has been compiled and is available on github.
Further updates and history is available in [Credits.md](Credits.md)
